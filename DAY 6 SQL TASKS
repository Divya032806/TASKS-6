--sub queries

Already I have created two tables so using same tables employees and department
select * from employees;
select * from department;


-- Scalar subquery
 
SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_salary > (SELECT AVG(emp_salary) FROM employees);

-- Column Subquery

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE EMP_ID IN (SELECT ID FROM department WHERE dept_name = 'IT');

-- Table subquery


SELECT emp_id, emp_name,
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id IN (SELECT ID FROM department);


-- Non correlated subquery 

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_salary > (SELECT AVG(emp_salary) FROM employees);


--Correlated subquery

SELECT emp_name
FROM employees e1
WHERE emp_salary > (SELECT AVG(emp_salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e1.emp_dept = e2.emp_dept);

select emp_name, emp_dept
from employees e
where emp_dept in (
    select dept_name
    from department d
    where exists (
        select 1
        from employees e2
        where e2.emp_dept = d.dept_name
        and e2.emp_salary > 50000
    )
);
